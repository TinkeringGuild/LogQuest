# LogQuest

This project is very much a Work-in-Progress and still in an alpha state.

Initially I want to create a Linux-compatible game overlay and notification system, similar to [GINA](https://eq.gimasoft.com/gina/), that solves my personal, immediate needs.

The next step is to achieve GINA feature-parity, including support for GINA's XML trigger format.

The ultimate plan is to go beyond GINA and create a next-generation log-based overlay system, notification system, log analyzer, and gameplay-enhancing toolkit that is fully cross-platform.

LogQuest will always remain compatible with the rules of Project 1999.

## How to run

At the moment there are no release binaries published.

You will need to have Rust, Tauri and NPM installed on your system to run LogQuest. Follow [the Tauri Prerequisites guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) for instructions on how to set that up for your system.

Once everything is installed, you simply run:

```
cd LogQuest
npm run tauri dev
```

# The Tinkering Guild

The Tinkering Guild seeks to develop and share useful tools for EverQuest players.

LogQuest ("LQ") is developed under the Tinkering Guild umbrella organization, therefore it's an open-source project open to all other EverQuest-loving developers, with a particular emphasis on use with Project 1999. LQ should be compatible with modern EverQuest ("Live"), however support for that will have to come when there are tinkerers who want to develop features for that use-case.
